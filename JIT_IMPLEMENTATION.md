# JIT Execution Implementation for Cheetah

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of JIT (Just-In-Time) execution for the Cheetah programming language. JIT execution allows Cheetah programs to be compiled to LLVM IR and then executed directly, without the need for an interpreter.

## Implementation Details

The JIT execution feature was implemented by:

1. Modifying the `run_file_jit` function in `src/main.rs` to:
   - Create a JIT execution engine for the compiled LLVM module
   - Register runtime functions with the execution engine
   - Look up the "main" function in the module
   - Execute the main function using the JIT execution engine

2. Adding similar functionality to the `run_repl_jit` function for interactive use.

## Current Status

The JIT execution feature is now working for basic Cheetah programs. The following features have been tested and confirmed working:

- Basic print functionality
- Variable assignments
- Arithmetic operations
- String operations

However, there are some limitations and issues:

- The range function or loop implementation may have issues (segmentation fault observed)
- Complex programs with nested functions or classes may not work correctly
- Error handling during JIT execution could be improved

## Example Usage

To run a Cheetah program using JIT execution:

```bash
cheetah -j examples/print_examples.ch
```

Or using the explicit run command:

```bash
cheetah run -j examples/print_examples.ch
```

## Future Improvements

1. Fix the range function and loop implementation
2. Improve error handling during JIT execution
3. Add support for more complex language features
4. Optimize the JIT compilation process
5. Add debugging support for JIT-compiled code
