# Cheetah Language Examples

This directory contains example Cheetah language files with the `.ch` extension.

## Running Examples

To run any example, use the `cheetah` command followed by the filename:

```bash
cheetah hello.ch
```

## Available Examples

- `hello.ch` - A simple "Hello World" program demonstrating basic Cheetah syntax
- `print_test.ch` - Examples of using the print() function with different data types

## File Extension

Cheetah source files use the `.ch` extension. If you provide a filename without an extension, the Cheetah interpreter will automatically add the `.ch` extension.

For example, these commands are equivalent:

```bash
cheetah hello.ch
cheetah hello
```

## Creating Your Own Examples

Feel free to create your own Cheetah programs with the `.ch` extension. The syntax is similar to Python, with some differences in implementation details.
